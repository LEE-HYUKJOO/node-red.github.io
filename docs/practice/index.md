*This guide is for who understands the basic fuctinality and want to develop more clear and reusable flows. If you thik that you are beginner, please read **[User Guide](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/)** and **[Cookbook](https://cookbook.nodered.org/)** first.*  

*In Node-RED, users can create flows easily and ad hoc. However, if you want to create more reusable and readable flows, some tips, practices and know how may be needed. Therefore, we would propose to create a new flow development guideline page to show such knowledge on Node-RED official page. We believe this page is useful for most Node-RED users.*  

*Before adding guideline to the Node-RED official page through a pull request, we would like to discuss contents and where to place it with somebody who are interested in this guideline. This wiki page is for discussing them.*  

*At first, weâ€™d like to show a contents list and where to place it on Node-RED official page. After that, we will write the actual contents and discuss it with Node-RED community because we would reduce unnecessary work.*
